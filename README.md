# KlockTermometer
This project uses a ds3231 to measure time and displays the time to an 1306 oled display. Further, it measures temprature with a analog temprature module and displays a mapped value to a 9g-servo-motor. It also uses an RBG LED to make it easy to see if the temperature is suitable for work by turning on a green light when the temp is comfortable.
